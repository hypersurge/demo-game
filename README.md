# roblox-ts Demo Template

Looking to get started with [**roblox-ts**](https://roblox-ts.github.io)?
Just download this repository to get started!

## Prerequisites
You'll need:
- NodeJS and NPM
- roblox-ts 0.1.7+ ( `npm i -g roblox-ts` )
- Rojo 0.5.x

If you're unsure on how to install these things, please refer to our ["Quick Start" guide](https://roblox-ts.github.io/docs/quick-start).

## Setup
`npm install`

## Usage
`rbxtsc && rojo build --output build.rbxmx`

This will compile your files into the `out` folder and then create a `build.rbxmx` to open in Roblox Studio.
